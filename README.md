# HT-Quiz-App

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of HT-Quiz-App, an advanced Android application developed as a part of the BSc (Hons) Computer Science program's Mobile Computing module. This app demonstrates not only my technical skills in mobile app development but also a keen understanding of user-centered design principles and interactive learning.

## Project Overview
HT-Quiz-App is crafted to provide an interactive educational experience through a multi-level quiz format, featuring user authentication and personalized feedback. Developed using Android Studio, the app stands as a testament to my ability to design, implement, and test a complex application that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Three Levels of Difficulty**: Each level designed to challenge the user progressively.
- **Engaging User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly, following modern UI/UX principles.
- **Instant Feedback**: Users receive immediate responses to their answers, enhancing the learning process.
- **Progress Tracking**: Each user's progress is meticulously tracked and stored.
- **Scalable Question Bank**: Easily expandable to include more questions and topics.

## Technical Highlights
- **Android Studio**: Utilized as the integrated development environment (IDE).
- **Java**: The main programming language for the app's logic.
- **XML**: Used for defining the app's layout and UI components.
- **SQLite**: For user data management and progress tracking.

## Design Philosophy
During the development process, emphasis was placed on user-centered design, ensuring that the app not only met the functional requirements but also delivered a superior user experience. The app design underwent iterative improvements based on real user feedback, aligning the final product closely with user expectations.

## Future Aspirations
As I continue to expand my expertise in mobile computing, I am eager to explore further how emerging technologies can be integrated into mobile applications to enhance educational tools.
